# Yeet
Custom wordlist generator

NB: CURRENTLY IN BETA STAGE (Currently advised to limit input & welcome to create a pull request)

Similar to cupp, but incorporates much more robust control over the words generated. But currently has issues with memory consumption.

### Usage:

Rep.txt:  Add words that are to be repeated inside the password (one per line)

Non_rep.txt:  Add words that occur only once inside the password (one per line)
